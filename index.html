    <h2>About</h2>
       <p> My favorite hobby is playing piano. I like playing the piano beacause you can listen to your own music. With a piano you can be ceative and create any song you want. You can also play other people's songs on the piano. On a piano you can make different sounds like high pitched and loud sounds. That is why i like playing the piano.</p>
